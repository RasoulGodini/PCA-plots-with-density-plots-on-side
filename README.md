The script will help to make PCA plots with density plots on the sides. It will do t-test for the eigenvectors to compare the distribution of samples based on PC1 and PC2. 

Note: the position of p-value annotations need be set manually.
Note: the applied data is random.

I hope you find it helpful.
Enjoy it.
